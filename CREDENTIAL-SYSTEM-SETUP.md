## 🧪 Testing

### Test the System:

2. **Start Frontend**: `npm run dev` (in frontend folder)
3. **Test Registration**: Go to `/register` and fill out the form
4. **Check Email**: Look for the credential email in your inbox
5. **Test Login**: Use the provided credentials to login

### Test Email Delivery:
